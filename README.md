# Ion-transistor-network
Code of three different network based on the behaviors of ion transistor. 

The packages used in the STP mode is the early version of Cross-Sim(v0.2.0). The latest version can be viewed in [Cross-Sim]. <https://github.com/sandialabs/cross-sim>

The codes of the LTP mode is based on Pytorch.

The codes of the LIF mode is based on [SNNtorch]. <https://github.com/jeshraghian/snntorch>
